- 🌸 Hi, I’m Treasure 
- 👩🏽‍💻 I’m interested in app development, database development and administration.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, PL/SQL, PHP, Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- 👯‍♀️ Open to connect and collaborate on intermediate level projects around Database Development and Administration.
- 😎 Fun fact: When i'm not writing queries, you can find me taking on a challenge against an online Scrabble player, listening to classic lo-fi, or engrossed in a good book.
